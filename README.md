# Hinglish Voice-AI Fine-Tuning

This project involves fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) to handle code-switched (Hinglish) dialogue. The goal is to create a Voice-AI capable of understanding and responding to Hinglish, a combination of Hindi and English.

## Project Overview

The project includes:
- **Dataset**: A small collection of Hinglish dialogue pairs.
- **Fine-Tuning**: The LLM is fine-tuned using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model on this Hinglish dataset.
- **Inference**: Sample dialogues generated from the fine-tuned model.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 10-20 dialogue pairs in Hinglish, where a user prompts a question and the assistant responds in Hinglish.

### Example Dialogue

```json
{"prompt":"User: Kaise ho?\nAssistant:","completion":"Main theek hoon, thanks for asking!"}
{"prompt":"User: Sunday ko kya plan hai?\nAssistant:","completion":"Shayad movie dekhne jaun."}
```

You can find the complete dataset in `dataset.jsonl` within the repository.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karkra911/Hinglish-Voice-AI-Fine-Tuning.git
```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install openai
```

3. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

## Fine-Tuning the Model

1. Upload the dataset to OpenAI:

```bash
openai.File.create(
  file=open("dataset.jsonl"),
  purpose='fine-tune'
)
```

2. Fine-tune the model using the `fine_tune.py` script:

```bash
python fine_tune.py
```

This will fine-tune the model with the dataset for 2 epochs.

## Generating Responses

Once the model is fine-tuned, you can use the `inference.py` script to generate responses from the fine-tuned model:

```bash
python inference.py
```

It will generate responses based on your Hinglish prompts.
